News Headline Fetcher
This website retrieves top news headlines from News API.

__Requirements__:

* A News API account with a valid API key (Free tier available for development) - https://newsapi.org/

* A live server environment (Local server or hosting provider). Browser-based requests are not allowed in the developer plan.


__Installation__:

Set up your development environment: Install the necessary tools and frameworks for your chosen backend language (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
Obtain your API key: Sign up for a free News API account and create an API key.


__Usage__:

Configure your server-side code:
Include the News API library for your chosen language.
Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your actual API key in the code.
Specify any additional parameters for filtering headlines (e.g., country, category).
Deploy your website: Run your server-side code on a live server environment.
Local server setups (e.g., Node.js with http-server) can be used for development. But I have used a python server. :)
For production, deploy to a hosting provider.


__Access the website__: 

Visit your website URL in a web browser. Your server-side code will fetch and display the top news headlines.


__Security__:

Never expose your API key directly in the client-side code (browser). This is a security risk.
Store your API key securely on the server-side.
